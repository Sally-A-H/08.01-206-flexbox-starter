Another very useful project from Skillcrush 'Coding a Responsive Website' course. This one has been somewhat personalised with content 
about myself, my own color choices and I used my own image here as well. I had a particularly fun time using my first webkit to 
integrate a gradient into the type over the image with the help of some very useful YouTube videos (thank you Hunter from Skillthrive 👊!) 
and a great site called 'uiGradients' which, once you've made your lovely gradient choice, gives you the CSS or HTML code to copy and link 
to 👍 .
I also really like the way in the mobile size my image scrolls under the type and isn't static although I am not really sure why this only 
happens in the mobile version .  . . hmmmm . . . must do research, must do research . . .  👀 !!
